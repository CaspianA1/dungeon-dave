super-priorities:
	- bug fixes
	- enemy AI
	- variable wall height extensions

features:
	- covered tops of walls
	- floor and ceiling with variable wall heights: if ceilings should work, the wall height should change depending on the point height
	- sets of enemy animations
	- enemy AI
	- doors
	- status bar while playing w/ a settings option in the title screen and on the status bar
	- animated skyboxes
	- escape mouse if pressing escape
	- a level opener, with a cool spinning effect (only for the first level)
	- fast floor/ceiling
	- a sprite pool
	- a skybox of a great city
	- an airship level
	- no pace if slow enough
	- close-range combat
	- an app: https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099
problems:
	- slowing down -> a keypress, resets speed
	- clipping into corners
	- small screen -> bigger screen or very small screen, edge triangles
	- z-buffering issues for higher point heights
	- player height needs to be readjusted when screen height changes (it also changes based on screen width)
	- min and max proj dist
	- empty z-buffer slots for ray_column_widths above 1
	- FOV effect increases more higher up (maybe change the max FOV for different height limits?)
	- draw_floor_plane doesn't draw some textures right
	- too many Mix_Chunks on the available channels -> out of channels
	- skybox stretching
	- some sides of textures get more drawn on them near the end than others
	- navigators use too much heap memory
