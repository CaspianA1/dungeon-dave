super-priorities:
	- bug fixes
	- enemy AI
	- variable wall height extensions

features:
	- covered tops of walls
	- floor and ceiling with variable wall heights: if ceilings should work, the wall height should change depending on the point height
	- stairs
	- enemy AI
	- jolt back when using weapon (a 'shaky' thing)
	- reuse Sprites in many places
	- doors
	- status bar while playing w/ a settings option in the title screen and on the status bar
	- animated skyboxes
	- escape mouse if pressing escape
	- floorcast multithreading, if horizontal method doesn't work
	- a level opener, with a cool spinning effect (only for the first level)
	- fast floor/ceiling
	- increase strafe speed and fov when pressing shift
	- a sprite pool
	- a skybox of a great city
	- an airship level
	- no pace if slow enough
	- store data like textures and maps in column-major order
	- an app: https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099
problems:
	- high CPU usage
	- slowing down -> a keypress, resets speed
	- flickering at the top of the small shotgun animation at some point
	- clipping into corners for player
	- small screen -> bigger screen or very small screen, edge triangles
	- z-buffering issues for higher point heights - one per point height segment
	- player height needs to be readjusted when screen height changes (it also changes based on screen width)
	- optimize floor shading (with `raycast_2`, there is some unnecessary floor shading)
	- make some sound effects quieter
	- weird lines for the hieroglyphics wall
	- final floors are not working
	- use intrinsics for VectorF2_line_pos
	- weird jump clipping needs to be fixed
	- need min and max proj dist
	- pthreads are glitching out
	- empty z-buffer slots for ray_column_widths above 1
	- SDL_PollEvent errors (that occur more with lower optimization)
	- FOV effect increases more higher up (maybe change the max FOV for different height limits?)
	- draw_floor_plane doesn't draw some textures right
	- falling through floors: corner clip -> jump, fall
	- too many Mix_Chunks on the available channels -> out of channels
	- skybox stretching
