super-priorities:
	- bug fixes
	- enemy AI
	- fast floors

features:
	- covered tops of walls
	- floor and ceiling with variable wall heights: if ceilings should work, the wall height should change depending on the point height
	- sets of enemy animations
	- enemy AI
	- doors
	- status bar while playing w/ a settings option in the title screen and on the status bar
	- animated skyboxes
	- escape mouse if pressing escape
	- a level opener, with a cool spinning effect (only for the first level)
	- a sprite pool
	- a skybox of a great city
	- an airship level
	- no pace if slow enough
	- collide with sprites
	- accelerate sideways
	- add back Adam's whip for close-range combat
	- a gui system
	- anti-aliasing
	- a file format
	- a map editor
	- seethrough sprites
	- an app: https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099
problems:
	- slowing down -> a keypress, resets speed
	- player clipping into corners
	- enemy clipping into walls
	- small screen -> bigger screen or very small screen, edge triangles
	- z-buffering issues with sprites for higher point heights
	- player height needs to be readjusted when screen height changes (it also changes based on screen width)
	- min and max proj dist
	- FOV effect increases more higher up (maybe change the max FOV for different height limits?)
	- too many Mix_Chunks on the available channels -> out of channels
	- skybox stretching
	- navigators use too much heap memory
	- less doubles and more ints in render_overlay.c
	- add back the BFS wall checking
	- don't intersect the player dot with walls in the minimap
	- shading is slow
	- hit detection for weapons is still sometimes spotty
	- abandon text surfaces and only keep the texture? will that work with floors?
	- skyboxes become wonky when the screen size increases
	- don't reallocate the `all_visited` var each time in bfs.c
	- disabling vsync makes everything choppy
	- vecs to double[2]'s in screen.dir_buffer
	- move row offset out of loop in floorcast
