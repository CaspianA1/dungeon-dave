features:
	- covered tops of walls
	- floor and ceiling with variable wall heights: if ceilings should work, the wall height should change depending on the point height
	- doors
	- status bar while playing w/ a settings option in the title screen and status bar
	- move mouse out of window if pressing escape
	- a level opener, with a cool spinning effect
	- a sprite pool
	- an airship level
	- collide with billboards
	- accelerate sideways
	- a gui system
	- a file format
	- a map editor
	- linearly interpolate actual_dist for more speed
	- floors at different height levels (not necessarily within just one block)
	- smooth mipmap depth switching, and mipmap a texture until its width or height reaches 1
	- mipmapping for sprites
	- a shotgun more in the art style of Adam's whip
	- Attacked state for enemy
	- a metro level
	- draw sprite sections in chunks
	- a sol enemy
	- bitplanes for floors
	- figure out lcov (?)
	- make each file an .o file, and then link them all together
	- faster enemy movement when nearer player (logarithmic scale)
	- only one sound effect at once - otherwise, out of channels
	- player death + sound for damage taken
	- an app: https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099
problems:
	- slowing down -> a keypress, resets speed
	- player clipping into corners
	- small screen -> bigger screen or very small screen, edge triangles
	- z-buffering issues with sprites for higher point heights
	- min and max proj dist
	- FOV effect increases more higher up (maybe change the max FOV for different height limits?)
	- too many Mix_Chunks on the available channels -> out of channels
	- skybox stretching
	- less doubles and more ints in render_overlay.c
	- don't intersect the player dot with walls in the minimap
	- shading is slow (it isn't the shading logic, it's the divisions)
	- skyboxes become wonky when the screen size increases
	- don't reallocate the `all_visited` var each time in bfs.c
	- disabling vsync makes everything choppy
	- vecs to double[2]'s in screen.dir_buffer
	- fix the offset problem for fast_affine_floor
	- sometimes, psprites disappear mid-game (use memory sanitizer to resolve the problem: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer) (also, each time that the minimap is enabled, the psprite becomes corrupted)
	- bogo is completely dark with the make rule `debug_2` (he is only light with -Ofast)
	- fix all of the memory leaks
	- a gray line appears for blur fixing
	- little blinking dots in the distance for the hieroglyphics bitmap
	- running head-on towards a navigator can make them temporarily clip into a wall

completed:
	- minimap that conveys height data
	- crosshair that stays aligned to the horizon
	- enemy AI with idle, chasing, attacking, and dead states, with BFS pathfinding; enemies have different sounds and animations depending on their state as well
	- weapons use DDA to detect collisions; option to allow weapon to have close and far range as well
	- rudimentary level creation interface
	- shading of diffuse circles and flat triangles, as well as environments that get darker when farther away
	- static and animated billboards (with only 1D z-buffering for now)
	- texture mapping, with mipmapping that incorporates box blur for cache coherency and fuzzy effects at a distance
	- audio system that allows for sound effects and background music
	- skyboxes that also change the portion shown based on the y-pitch
	- raycasting with multiple floor heights (no multi-dimensional floors though, yet)
	- use of vector intrinsics and optimized bitmatrix data structure to ease performance on older devices
	- free look, with y-shearing and turning controlled by the mouse
	- accurate movement physics, both in terms of 2D acceleration + deceleration, and Y-axis jumping
	- increase in FOV while accelerating, screen tilt when strafing, and additional y-shearing when moving, giving a 'pacing' effect
	- remappable keybindings for movement
	- memory leak tracking system
	- planar mode + noclip mode
