Levels:
- Final touches on the fortress map
- A castle level that's crazy high in the sky, where you can look down really far; and a mountain level, like Mount Fuji - running along the mountainside
- A level based on the Zhangjiajie region
- A map like this one: https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/the-sultans-palace-3351849/ (can look up similar Sultan maps for Minecraft)

Final lighting model:
- Note: too many fancy lighting effects may make the game look less retro, so set some hard limit to that.
- Ambient, diffuse, specular (with procedural specular mapping), HDR, banding removal, light color - done
- Ambient occlusion through an occlusion map, maybe
- Perhaps make the shadows contact-hardening
- If not CSMs, another technique like PSMs or LiSPSMs
- A compressed texture for the depth map, to save space?
- If ESM isn't good enough in the end, use EVSM with only the positive term (if it's fast enough): https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2013/09/10/shadow-maps/
- And optimized copying: face mesh in a VBO, and then selectively copy to a second VBO for culling. First VBO then used for dry rendering for shadow map
- For AO, if I instance the texture ID across a whole sector, that way I can get 256 different textures per level, and I can pre-bake ambient occlusion into sectors

Shadow mapping:
- The glDrawArrays call in shadow mapping uses around 30% of my GPU time mostly because of the shadow map size
- Generate level edge geometry specifically for the shadow map, and cache that with a copy of a static geometry buffer (also pre-cull front faces; perhaps via transform feedback)
- Possibly one shadow map for static objects (sectors and bridges), and small dynamic ones for billboards (low-res small one, but smoothed out with RBSM), only if that works with something like CSM

- For a sun bounding box, imagine a rotated OBB encompassing an AABB that represents the world:
	- First, make an encompassing OBB around a 2D AABB box
	- The box doesn't need to encompass the AABB at first, it just needs to be rotated
	- It can then be resized to the AABB area after
	- Then, expand that to 3D

- After CSM, implement SDSM
- ESM logarithmic space filtering: https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2009/SIGGRAPH%202009%20-%20Lighting%20Research%20at%20Bungie.pdf
- Rescale the ESM constant based on the distance between the occluder and the receiver, maybe
- Filtering in exp(gl_FragCoord.z) may remove some shadow acne

CSM:
- If there is still too much light bleeding in the end, perhaps switch to one-term EVSM
- Make the weapon cast a shadow
- Weapon NDC to world-space like this: https://feepingcreature.github.io/math.html (note: idea didn't fully work at first)
- Current CSM scheme:
	ESM with linear + trilinear (i.e. with mipmaps) + anisotropic filtering;
	per-frame mipmap generation is expensive. A 3x3 PCF kernel.
- CSM scheme:
	linear for near and far, while using CSM for resolution management
	(same effect as mipmap selection) + anisotropic filtering. A 5x5 PCF kernel.
	With this, realtime shadow map generation, and better resolution management.

Architectural/code design ideas:
- More efficiently set statemap bit ranges, maybe
- Catch more warnings with -Weverything
- File paths may not work on Windows
- Pass in texture parameters through a bitmask
- Use CMake instead of Make for cross-platform compilation
- Set up dependencies properly in the Makefile
- Call SDL_GetTicks or SDL_GetPerformanceCounter only once per frame
- Macros for common initialization and deinitalization of OpenGL objects (like gl_init, gl_use, and gl_deinit); or no macros at all
- Can store one more byte in a sector with it staying 16 bytes - maybe do something more with that?
- Perhaps use the texture id map as a texture, and use the other 5 bits in the face info bitset for something else (lighting params, if enough precision?)
- Separate out context + window creation and utils
- Define the constants in constants.h in constants.c, and make the constants.h struct extern
- Three classes of settings: hardcoded in the `constants` struct, configurable via a level file, and configurable by the player
- A LevelDescription struct that then a SceneState (or some other) struct uses to generate sectors, a shadow map, etc.
	If levels come from C files, put those directly in files; otherwise, JSON will be turned into a LevelDescription.
	The advantage to C files is that you don't have to parse a file for each level; the disadvantage is that map files
	are then not easily editable
- Perhaps use the alpha channels of the face texture set or normal map set for something interesting
- Some library memory leaks; this should be fixed in some way, if possible
- Make sector and billboard contexts contain all context necessary, not just fragmented around the SceneState struct
- Use more of the cglm functions in `update_camera`, or make my own
- Instead of hardcoding the beginning of each asset path ("../assets/"), abstract it away with a macro that concatenates a simpler path with the base path
- Some sort of common draw context, that when invoked, binds a shader, vertex buffer and vertex spec and draws
- Possibly in the end, map representations: heightmap + texture id map, cpu mesh, gpu mesh, and culled mesh for shadow map
- Perhaps use just OpenGL + ImGUI for the editor

Miscellaneous problems:
- Having an idle window with vsync on leads to high CPU and GPU usage
- The checker heightmap has faster pacing sometimes

Object rendering:
- Up-and-down moving platforms that can also work as doors (continually up-and-down moving, down if player close, or down if action fulfilled)
- Some type of bridge object (perhaps not axis-aligned; just an arbitrary plane)
- A sector BVH, through metasector trees, also called binary r-trees (alloc through node pool)
- Billboard lighting that matches the sector lighting (share uniforms via a uniform buffer object)

Random feature ideas:
- A map editor. Read in a json file that has dimensions, a heightmap, a texture id map, and a texture list.
	Choose texture or height through number keys (done), draw/move/erase modes (done), line mode, save button,
	zoom in/out, scroll with the mouse.
- Can't use red cross for health since it's copyrighted
- Find a way to have low-res textures that are not blurry or have a loss of detail (nearest = shimmery, and linear = blurry; perhaps more antialiasing for nearest?). This addresses nearest: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/93466/multisampled-nearest-filtering-in-ps-2-0-is-it-possible
- Gauge the number of multisample samples based on a runtime constant
- Find a tighter far plane distance by finding the diameter of the sector convex hull

Normal mapping:
- Improper shadow coverage at edges of objects leads to some in-shadow areas having normal map details shown
- Mipmaps of normal maps are not normalized, and they disappear at lower mip levels
	(Generate mipmaps on the CPU, and verify that they can mipmap plain textures like glGenerateMipmap)
- Perhaps blur the surfaces on the GPU - that way, only one blurrer between shadow maps and normal maps (only if using a shadow method that needs pre-blurring)
- Share some of the looping logic for the Gaussian blur and the normal map generation
- Little rectangular bumps exist in high-resolution normal maps with already fine detail
- Vary the normal map generation parameters based on the output texture size
- Define normal map settings for each wall texture (only useful at normal map generation time).
	Choose a hash map or an array for association between path and settings

A better shading model:
- Share shader uniforms via uniform buffer objects (mostly for a LightParams struct)
- Share code between shaders (mostly need to share a `shade_world_fragment` function, and the lighting uniform
	block definition; perhaps build a manual #include mechamism, or link completed shaders together)

Physics:
	Features:
	- Sliding across the floor (with the head tilted up), or crouching (either for avoiding enemy projectiles)
	- If hitting a wall, base the player's speed on the dot product of your 2D direction vector
		and the wall's normal vector (perhaps find the wall vector from my movement delta). Axis where
		no moving happened indicates normal vector orientation. If below tile pos, bottom tile; otherwise, top tile.
		Same idea for side tiles.
	Problems:
	- FPS at 120 -> too fast acceleration, which leads to too-fast weapon pacing
	- Pressing left + forward and backward doesn't stop moving on the X axis
	- A half-stutter when pressing towards a wall and then letting go of a movement key
	- Can get a tiny bit stuck in a wall when jumping downwards close to a wall (so the player will
			have to be able to stand off the wall by half of the extent of the top-down bounding box)

Other:
- Sultan or vizier?
- Set up a little website for the game, with various video clips of gameplay
- Perhaps the Shabti should blink

End components:
- Static sectors
- Dynamic sectors
- Bridges (perhaps instead of dynamic sectors)
- Billboards (unanimated and animated)
- Skybox
- Weapon
- Particles from a projectile - billboards with a shared texture id
- HUD
- UI
