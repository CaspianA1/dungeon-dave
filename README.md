### Dependencies

- To install any dependencies, navigate to `install_scripts` and run the build script for your platform.

### Building

Simply run `build.sh`, passing the build type as the first argument (`debug` or `release`).
If you wish to run the project as well, you can specify the second argument to be `run`.
